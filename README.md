## ABOUT 🧬
> [!TIP]
> Imagine the amazing good fortune of the generation that gets to see the end of the world. This is as marvelous as being there in the beginning. How could one not wish for that with all one's heart? How could one not lend one's feeble resources to bringing it about?
> - Baudrillard, Fragments: Cool Memories III, 1990-1995
