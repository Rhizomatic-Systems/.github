**Rhizomatic Systems** is a technical collective dedicated to dismantling power asymmetries between individuals and institutional forces—from the military-industrial complex to state apparatuses—through the democratization of information and equipment. We provide solutions that span agriculture, security, communications, media, and beyond, unified by a singular purpose: **restoring autonomy to those who face its erosion**.

### Origins & Philosophy

Born from a deep engagement with Deleuze and Guattari's *Anti-Oedipus* and *A Thousand Plateaus*, Rhizomatic Systems takes its name and ethos from the rhizome—a non-hierarchical, decentralized network that grows horizontally, resists centralized control, and creates unexpected connections. Established online in 2025, we emerged not as a traditional company, but as a **tactical intervention** against the enclosure of knowledge and the monopolization of capability.

Our approach applies Deleuzian philosophy directly to DevOps: we build systems that are **multiplicitous, deterritorialized, and resistant to capture**. We reject arborescent structures—the tree-like hierarchies that concentrate power—in favor of distributed architectures that enable autonomy, resilience, and collective action.

### Mission

We exist to **compete with intellectual property regimes** that obstruct human advancement and threaten the stability of life itself. Patents, proprietary systems, and information asymmetries are not neutral—they are weapons wielded by institutions to maintain dominance. Rhizomatic Systems counters this through open technical solutions that anyone can access, modify, and deploy.

### Who We Serve

Our work is for:
- **Data sovereignty advocates** seeking control over their digital existence
- **Privacy and anonymity practitioners** who refuse surveillance capitalism
- Those pursuing **anonymity with reputation**—the ability to build trust without exposure
- **Insurrectionists and disruptors** throwing spanners in the works of oppressive systems and recreating the means of production
- **Communities and individuals** facing threats to their autonomy, whether from corporate monopolies, state surveillance, governmental annihilation, or institutional coercion

We don't serve customers—we **arm collaborators**. Our clients are co-conspirators in the project of building parallel infrastructures that operate outside, and in opposition to, systems of control.

### Our Work

From agricultural technologies that break automation monopolies to security tools that protect activists and outliers, our solutions are **rhizomatic by design**: adaptable, reproducible, and impossible to fully suppress. We build for resilience, not profit. We distribute capability, not dependency.

**Rhizomatic Systems is not a company. It is a line of flight.**
